Later  in  2015,  RCUES,  Mumbai  is  identiﬁed  as  a  technical  service  provider  in            Municipal Solid Waste Management projects under Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) launched by the            MoHUA, GoI.            Over the years, RCUES of AIILSG Mumbai has been working in close coordination with state and local            Governments to provide strategic, advisory, technical and capacity building support for assessment            and improvement in infrastructure service delivery in cities.            Along with ULBs, it is also engaging with multiple stakeholders like NGOs/CBOs, SHGs, private sector            organisations, ﬁnancial institutions at city level for providing technical and strategic support focusing            on preparing action plans/strategies, technical assessment reports, CSPs/CDPs/DPRs as well as on-            ground support by engaging with communities for improvement in various urban sectors to ensure            improved quality of life to the citizens. AIILSG, Mumbai is also working at the grass root level in cities            through ﬁeld visits, guiding ULB oﬃcials, conducting situation assessments with the objective of            bridging the gap between the cities and state for sustainable sanitation solutions under Swachh            Bharat Mission Urban.            In  February  2016,  the  Ministry  of  Housing  and  Urban  Poverty  Alleviation,  Government  of  India            empaneled the RCUES of AIILSG, Mumbai for conducting training and capacity building programme            for experts of SMMU, CMMUs, COs, Key Oﬃcials and other stakeholders of the states and ULBs under            Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY – NULM).

AIILSG  Mumbai  is  supporting  the  states  of  Maharashtra,            Rajasthan and Goa for the same.            Through all these activities, RCUES of AIILSG Mumbai is striving to transform the notion of capacity            building  by  not  limiting  itself  to  trainings  /  workshops  but  engaging  with  the  state  and  local            governments at multiple levels. With a small but enthusiastic team, RCUES, Mumbai will continue to            strive towards improving the capabilities of municipal oﬃcials with a broader objective towards            developing able governments thereby enabling better cities.

Municipal functionaries and elected representatives            from ULBs are key actors in eﬀective implementation of these missions at city level.             RCUES, Mumbai is committed to support eﬀective implementation of these programmes to achieve            the outcomes as envisaged in the Mission Guidelines, by undertaking structured capacity building            programmes for the ULBs. Thus, RCUES, Mumbai's calendar for the year 2019-20 is developed in            alignment with the State and ULB level agenda, to facilitate achievement of targets in the given time            frame under the various programmes and missions.             All the training and capacity building programmes of RCUES, Mumbai are designed in such a way that            they would be directly beneﬁcial to relevant ULB oﬃcials in implementing missions and policies            eﬀectively at the city level. Our experience of working with this module shows that knowledge sharing            and peer learning in this manner encourages and guides the ULBs in achieving dedicated targets            towards missions. Such programmes also create a platform for disseminating interactive resource            material which is especially prepared for greater understanding of all the participants.            They  also  call  for  a  dialogue  between  the  State  and  ULBS  for  suggestions  and  ideas  for  overall            improvement so as to make the programmes beneﬁcial as well as lucrative to the participants. With            this, we aim to add value to the urban development scenario in states through contributing towards            the capacity building of ULBs. On this note, RCUES, Mumbai welcomes all to the capacity building            programmes and seminars in the year 2019-20.","Activities                         Research / Case Study            Supporting State Governments in Dry Waste Management            RCUES Undertakes            Urban Policy, Technical Advisory Services, Tailored Training and Capacity Building, Preparation of City            Development  Plans,  City  Sanitation  Plans,  Detailed  Project  Reports,  Action  Plans,  Research  \&            Documentation,  Knowledge  Management,  Information,  Education  \&  Communication  (IEC),            Community Based Interventions, Project Management and Consultancy, Training of Trainers (TOT),            Study Visits for Experience Sharing and Cross learning, Human Resource Development.
